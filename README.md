# 🛰️ P2P Messenger Application

## 📌 Introduction

### 1.1 Brief Overview

- **What:**  
  A peer-to-peer (P2P) messenger application that enables users to communicate directly without the need for a centralized server.  
- **Why:**  
  Traditional client-server messaging systems rely on centralized servers that may introduce latency, data privacy concerns, and single points of failure. A P2P approach mitigates these risks by enabling direct communication, improving privacy, and reducing reliance on intermediaries.

### 1.2 Objectives

- ✅ Build a secure and efficient P2P messenger using **WebRTC** for real-time communication.  
- ✅ Implement **encryption** for secure message transmission.  
- ✅ Support **text messaging**, **file sharing**, and **voice messaging**.

### 1.3 Setup

To run this P2P messenger:

1. Ensure [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) is installed.
2. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
3. Run:

```bash
npm install
npm start
